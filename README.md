<p>Over the past 9 months, Covid-19 has had a transformative impact on society. Given the impact that I have personally faced, I wanted to channel my data science skills so that I could analyze, and visualize insights so that I can better understand the magnitude of the pandemic.</p>

<h1>Basic Visualization and Analysis</h1>

<p> Above is a visualization of cases over time in the United States. As expected the cases have increased over time. </p>

<p> Above is a visualization of the ratio of deaths to cases. I find this interesting becuase this ratio has decreased over time. It would be interesting to know why this ratio has decreased. Are we better at treating Covid-19? Has a different demographic been getting infected with Covid more recently? </p>
